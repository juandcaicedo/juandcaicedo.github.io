I'm Juan Caicedo, a graduate student in Carleton University's Department of Sociology focusing on the intersection of education, the economy, and labour. I earned a BA in Political Science with Honours at the University of Chicago and an MA in Political Science at York University concurrently with a Diploma in Democratic Administration.

Outside of academia, I've conducted research in a variety of contexts, often with a focus on education and political and economic issues. Most recently, I worked as the Data and Impact Team Assistant at the STEM education non-profit Let's Talk Science, developing qualitative and quantitative insights into the organization's reach among Canadian youth. Iâ€™ve also conducted research for and fact-checked reports and articles on subjects ranging from corporate lobbying, policing and technology, climate change, and more for the magazine *In These Times*, the Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE), and *Vice Canada*. Additionally, I contributed articles on arts and culture to the Chicago-based newspaper *South Side Weekly*, which you can find [here](https://southsideweekly.com/author/juan-caicedo/).

In my free time, aside from reading, drinking coffee, and catching movies at the Bytowne or Mayfair, I like to take film photographs, and you can see some examples [here!](https://juandcaicedo.github.io/portfolio/)
